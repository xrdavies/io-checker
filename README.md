- Send any message to the bot
- The bot will reply with your information, including your chat ID.

#### Alternatively, if you want to get a chat ID for a group:
- Create a Telegram bot (if you haven't already):
- Start a chat with BotFather (@BotFather)
- Send the command /newbot and follow the prompts
- Save the API token you receive
- Add your bot to the group you want to send messages to.
- Send a message in the group, mentioning the bot (e.g., "@your_bot_name hello").
- Access this URL in your web browser, replacing <BOT_TOKEN> with your actual bot token:
```
https://api.telegram.org/bot<BOT_TOKEN>/getUpdates
```
- Look for the "chat" object in the JSON response. The "id" field in this object is your group chat ID. It will typically be a negative number for group chats.
